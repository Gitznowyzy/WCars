    <p>
    So far, Web Design has been both challenging and fun. I have learned a lot of skills, and the different ways of applying them to create a web page.</p>
    <p>Here is a list of what I have learnt and the different ways I have been able to apply them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Basics of HTML: This was how I learnt the proper structure of HTML code and different HTML tags. This was very useful because without the basics I would not be able to code a web page its proper structure</li>
        <li>HTML Lists: I learnt how to create both ordered and unordered lists.</li>
        <li>PBL on The Intersection of A.I and Programming: I worked woth a parter to creat a web page presentation on how A.I is used in programming and how they complement each other</li>
        <li>HTML Links and Images: I learnt how to add differnt images and links to my webpage. I also learnt how to make a link pen up in a differnt page.</li>
        <li>HTML Tables: I learnt how to make a table of differnt rows and columns for imputing tabled data</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
